#Python variables

#example1 
x = 5
y = "John"
print(x) #output: 5
print(y) #output: John

#example2

x = 4      # x is of type int
x = "Sally" # x is now of type str
print(x) #output: Sally

#example3

x = str(3)    # x will be '3'
y = int(3)     # y will be 3
z = float(3)   # z will be 3.0

#example4

x = 5
y = "John"
print(type(x)) #output: <class'int'>
print(type(y)) #output: <class 'str'>

#example5

x = "John"
# is the same as
x = 'John'

#example6

a = 4
A = "Sally"
#A will not overwrite a
